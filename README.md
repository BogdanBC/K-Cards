About K-Cards

K-Cards are used for facilitating discussions and keeping track of discussion threads. They were first used by a group of software testers as part of their peer-conference facilitation at events like WTSTs (Workshop on Teaching Software Testing) and WOC (Workshop on Open Certification). The initial concept was developed and used by Paul Holland, his wife Karen and Scott Barber. 

The facilitator of a discussion keeps track of discussion threads/topics and who wants to (still) talk about them using color cards that the participants show. 

Here are all the colors and their meaning:

·   Green: Please place me on the new thread list

·   Yellow: Pleas place me on the same thread list

·   Red (or pink): Oooh, oooh, I must speak now (or important admin issue: e.g.: I can’t hear)

·   Blue (or purple): I feel this discussion is becoming (or has become) a rat hole. – This one is not used at larger conferences.
